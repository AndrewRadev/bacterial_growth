# Introduction

Î¼GrowthDB is a database of growth data for microorganisms. It is designed to be a central repository for growth data, and to provide a platform for the sharing and discovery of growth data.

This documentation is meant for contributing to the development process, or for somebody who wants a local installation of the database. The information in "Developer guides" describes some of the fundamental building blocks of the code. The "Reference documentation" section contains documentation auto-generated from the code.
