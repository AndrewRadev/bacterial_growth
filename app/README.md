# Setting Up MySQL Database Locally

To set up a MySQL database locally, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Install MySQL Server

If you haven't already installed MySQL Server on your machine, you can download and install it from the official MySQL website ([MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)).

## Step 2: Start MySQL Server

After installation, start the MySQL server on your local machine. You can usually do this through your system's services manager or by running a command in the terminal or command prompt.

## Step 3: Access MySQL Command Line

Once the MySQL server is running, access the MySQL command line interface by opening a terminal or command prompt and entering the following command (source + the path where the db schema is located in your machine):

```sql
source C:\Users\sofia\Desktop\bacterial_growth\src\sql_scripts\create_db.sql
