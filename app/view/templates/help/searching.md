## Search form

On the search page, by default, you can see the 20 latest studies uploaded. You can enter a specific search query to find studies that match certain criteria.

<p>
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" title="Form components" src="/static/images/help/searching/search-form.png" />
    </div>
</p>

You can use the dropdown to choose what your query will be matched with. For instance, if you have a specific study ID like "SMGDB00000002", you can enter that and pick "Study ID" to find the single study that has that identifier. You can also search by a study's **project**, or the microbial **strains** or **metabolites** that were used in a study.

By checking the "Advanced search" option, you can add multiple different clauses to your search, combined with "AND", "OR", or "NOT" logical operators to describe more specifically what study you're looking for.

## New search form (beta)

A new search form is currently available when clicking on "New search form (beta)". This will eventually be the default and this help documentation will be updated. This form updates as you type and allows quickly finding a study based on text included in its name or description, or based on the strains and metabolites it includes.

<p>
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" title="Form components" src="/static/images/help/searching/new-search-form-1.png" />
    </div>
</p>

Clicking on the "Search" button will load the page with the query and update the browser's URL, letting you send your search to someone else or bookmark it for later.

You can paste the unique public identifier of a study to find it quickly. Or, if you know its numeric ID, you can type in "smgdb" followed by that number. For instance, to find study "SMGDB00000003", you can type "smgdb3":

<p>
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" title="Form components" src="/static/images/help/searching/new-search-form-2.png" />
    </div>
