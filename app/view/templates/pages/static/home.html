      <p>
        µGrowthDB is a relational database that provides a structure to store
        different types of microbial growth data. Our main objective is to
        serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers interested in
        studying the growth dynamics of microbial species by providing access
        to growth projects and studies uploaded by other researchers.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="{{ url_for('search_index_page') }}">
          Search for growth studies
        </a>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Users can search for experimental data collected from microbial growth
        studies based on the study or project name. The search can be filtered
        by different experimental conditions and characteristics like the
        microbial strains or metabolites that were analyzed in the study.
        All of the data at µGrowthDB is publicly available for everyone.

      <p>
        At µGrowthDB, we recognize the invaluable contributions of researchers
        in advancing our understanding of microbial dynamics. Sharing growth
        data publicly plays a crucial role in increasing scientific progress
        and collaboration within the research community.
      </p>

      <p>
        We allow researchers to authenticate themselves using
        <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ORCID iD</a>
        and upload their experimental data by following a step-by-step process
        that ensures it fits a standardized structure.

        Visualize and analyze growth data
      </h3>

      <p>
        Visitors can visualize the growth of microbial cultures within or
        across experiments in any published study. They can also collect data
        traces in different studies and investigate them in our
        "<a href="{{ url_for('comparison_show_page') }}">Comparison view</a>".
        For further analysis, the raw data can be downloaded from studies' "export" pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Study owners can fit select growth models to their data through the web interface, courtesy of the
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/growthrates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          growthrates R package
        </a>. Growth parameters can be downloaded in CSV format.
