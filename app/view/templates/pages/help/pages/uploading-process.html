  provided in the <strong>Upload data</strong> page. Once you download
  the corresponding Excel templates for your study, you must complete
  these following the instructions provided within the
  <strong>README</strong> sheet. A detailed explanation step by step

    <h2>Complete the data template:</h2>

    <h3>1. Identify the number of experiment study</h3>
    <h4>What is an experiment?</h4>

    <p>
      An experiment represents a unique set of experimental conditions
      or treatments applied to a set/group of biological replicates.
      Control cases should be considered as distinct experiments.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Identify the number of biological replicates in your experiment</h3>
    <h4>What is a biological replicate?</h4>

    <p>
      A biological replicate is a distinct sample/measurement within an
      experiment. Data regarding growth and/or metabolite levels should
      be provided for the available time points and for every
      biological replicate. Note: positive or negative controls are
      considered also as a separate experiment.
    </p>

    <h4>Cases:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You're studying how bacteria grow in different nutrient
          environments, you set up 3 separate flasks, each containing
          the same culture of bacteria  in a different nutrient
          solution. Each flask represents a different experiment with
          only one biological replicate for each of them.
          <strong>Total number of biological replicates per experiment: 1</strong>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You're studying how 3 bacterial strains grow in a nutrient
          environment, you set up 3 separate flasks, each containing a
          culture of one of the strains in the same nutrient solution.
          Each flask represents a separate experiment.
          <strong>Total number of biological replicates per experiment: 1</strong>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You're studying how bacteria grow in different tree different
          nutrient environments, you set up 3 separate flasks for each
          of them containing the same culture of bacteria.
          <strong>Total number of biological replicates per experiment: 3</strong>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>3. Identify the number of technical replicates per biological replicate:</h3>

    <h4>What is a technical replicate?</h4>

    <p>
      Technical replicates are repeated measurements of the same sample
      that demonstrate the variability of the protocol. Technical
      replicates are important because they address the reproducibility
      of the assay or technique. In case of having technical replicates
      please report the average and standard deviation per time-point
      measured in the corresponding data template.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Let's complete the data template:</h3>

    <h4>Growth_Data_Metabolites</h4>

    <p>
      In this sheet you will have to complete only the measurements
      related to the following techniques:
      <strong>OD, Plate-counts, Flow Cytometry total cell counts, metabolite concentrations</strong>.

      Whether you used a micro-plate, a cuvette, a bottle or a mini
      bioreactor, each individual vessel (cuvette, well or bottle) will
      represent a unique <strong>Biological_Replicate_id</strong>.

      Let's assume you used a micro-plate to measure OD in only 2 wells
      (positions A1 and A2). Your raw data could look like in the image
      below. Let's complete our template using this toy example. In
      this case we will have 2 biological replicate ids (A1 and A2) you
      can choose any alphanumerical option as long as is unique and
      informative to you. Then each row will represent a time-point
      measurement per replicate id. In this case only one measurement
      per well was taken, this indicates that the number of technical
      replicates is 1. In case you took more than one measure per well
      the OD_std must be completed too. The same applies for all the
      other methods.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h4>Growth_Data_Metabolites: Metabolite concentrations</h4>

    <p>
      If in your data, you also measure the concentration of different
      metabolites per vessel (cuvette, well or tube), complete each
      column associated with each metabolite, every row will be
      associated with a time-point and a <strong>biological replicate id</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume that for each of the previous well-plates (A1 and
      A2) you measured also the concentration of glucose and acetate.
      Transform your raw data if necessary  so it matches the
      Biological_Replicate_id column.  Fill the concentration values
      for each time-point and replicate_id (e.g. A1 and A2) in each of
      the metabolite columns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complete our template using the last toy example. For every
      Biological_Replicate_id we will complete the concentration values
      of glucose and acetate for each time-point.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h4>Growth_per_Species:</h4>

    <p>
      If in your data, you also measure abundances of more than one
      bacterial species (by Flow Cytometry or 16S rRNA gene sequencing),
      your data template will have another sheet (Growth_per_Species). In
      a similar way than in the other sheet, complete each row with the
      corresponding <strong>Biological_replicate_id</strong>,
      <strong>Time</strong> and the values of per species.
