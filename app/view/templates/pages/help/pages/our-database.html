<h2>µGrowthDB</h2>

<p>
  µGrowthDB is a relational database written in MySQL. It contains 12
  tables: project, study, experiment, biological replicate, biological
  replicate metadata, metabolite, metabolite per biological replicate,
  compartment, community, community member, taxa and perturbation. The
  definition of the tables that are most important to understand how
  the microbial growth database is structured are provided below.

<table class="simple-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Term</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Definition</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
      <td>
        A project represents a distinct research endeavor focused on
        microbial growth. It serves as the overarching container for
        organizing related studies and experiments. The user will need
        to specify the corresponding project for the study described in
        this template at the time of submitting the document to the
        database.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Study</strong></td>
      <td>
        A study conducted within the framework of a project refers to a
        focused investigation aimed at exploring a specific aspect of
        microbial growth. Each study is carefully designed to address
        particular research questions or hypotheses and may involve
        multiple experiments. In case of well plates, a study should
        represent a single plate.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Experiment</strong></td>
      <td>
        An experiment represents a unique set of experimental
        conditions or treatments applied to a set/group of biological
        replicates. Control cases should be considered as distinct
        experiments.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Biological Replicate</strong></td>
      <td>
        A biological replicate is a distinct sample/measurement within
        an experiment. Data regarding growth and/or metabolite levels
        should be provided for the available time points and for every
        biological replicate.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Compartment</strong></td>
      <td>
        A compartment is a distinct section or partition within the
        growth environment (or “vessel”) where biological samples are
        grown under specific environmental conditions. Each compartment
        corresponds to a different set of environmental parameters
        (e.g., temperature, pH, medium etc.) tailored to the
        requirements of the experiment. An experiment needs to have at
        least one compartment.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Community</strong></td>
      <td>
        Consists of one or more members. Each experiment needs to have
        at least one community, unless it consists of a control without
        any microbial community.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Community Member</strong></td>
      <td>A microbial strain present in at least one experiment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Perturbation</strong></td>
      <td>
        Refers to a deliberate disturbance or alteration applied to a
        specific experiment. It may refer to a perturbation in the
        environmental conditions described in the corresponding
        compartment and/or changes to the community (e.g., introducing
        new strains).
      </td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>
  Given that µGrowthDB is a relational database, each table contains
  foreign keys to establish the different relationships between the
  tables. For example, a project within the database contains a study.
  This relationship is created thanks to the projectId, which is a
  foreign key that uniquely identifies a project (Project table row) to
  a study (Study table row).
