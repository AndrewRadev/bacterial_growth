## Search form

On the search page, by default, you can see the 5 latest studies uploaded. You can scroll down and click "Load more" to keep exploring older studies. You can start typing a specific search query to find studies based on their title or description, or based on the strains and metabolites they include.

    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" title="Form components" src="/static/images/help/searching/search-form-1.png" />
    </div>
</p>

You can use the dropdown to choose what your query will be matched with. For instance, if you have a specific study ID like "SMGDB00000002", you can enter that and pick "Study ID" to find the single study that has that identifier. You can also search by a study's **project**, or the microbial **strains** or **metabolites** that were used in a study.

Clicking on the "Search" button will load the page with the query and update the browser's URL, letting you send your search to someone else or bookmark it for later.

You can paste the unique public identifier of a study to find it quickly. Or, if you know its numeric ID, you can type in "smgdb" followed by that number. For instance, to find study "SMGDB00000003", you can type "smgdb3":

    </div>
</p>

## Advanced search form

By clicking the "Advanced search" option, you can add multiple different clauses to your search, combined with "AND", "OR", or "NOT" logical operators to describe more specifically what study you're looking for. It can be a slower process to build up a query like that, but if you have exact filtering criteria, you might find it beneficial.
