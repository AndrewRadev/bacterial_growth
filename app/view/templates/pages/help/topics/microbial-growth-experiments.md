The starting point of a growth experiment in the lab is the inoculation of a cell culture in a chosen medium. Cells use nutrients from this medium to grow and replicate. The first phase of growth is known as the **lag phase** (1). [Baranyi et al](https://doi.org/10.1006/fmic.1993.1005) describe this period as a time of adaptation of the cell culture to the new environment it finds itself in. For instance, new enzymes need to be synthesized to activate metabolic pathways that can take full advantage of the environment. Each cell expends some energy shifting its metabolism before it starts to replicate.

As the cells accumulate biomass, they divide, so we expect to see them double their number after a certain period of time. As each one replicates again and again, their number will grow exponentially. The mean number of doublings per cell per unit of time is their **specific growth rate**. In the **exponential phase** (2), the cell culture has reached its maximum specific growth rate for this medium. This is the number of replications that each cell is capable of in this environment per unit of time.

This second phase is also referred to as a "log phase" for "logarithm", since log-transforming the growth data shows a linear increase in the logarithm of the population, driven by the constant growth rate. According to [Ghenu et al](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1313500), the maximum growth rate is the trait that has the greatest impact when cells need to compete for resources, making it a good proxy for fitness. Researchers looking to, for example, develop novel antibiotics or to investigate the impact of mutations are likely to rely on this value.

In the **stationary phase** (3), the rate of cell division slows down and becomes equal to the cell death rate. As a result, the total population is maintained constant. The decrease in net growth is inevitable given the physical limits of the containing vessel, but it can also be triggered by nutrient depletion or an accumulation of waste products. It is also possible that cell cultures detect crowding and slow down their own growth before starvation kicks in. Within microbial multi-species communities, competition may also play a factor.

In the **death phase** (4), the cell death rate overtakes the growth rate and cell abundances show a gradual decline. Some microorganisms might transition into a more resilient state, arresting growth and maintaining a minimal population. This kind of long-term stationary phase may continue for months to years, depending on the organism.

None of these phases are guaranteed to be present in any given experiment, and they do not necessarily transition cleanly into one another. The exponential phase may continue indefinitely in a continuous-growth culture. The lag phase may be missing if cells are inoculated from one medium to a comparable one. The stationary phase may be undetectable if conditions change quickly enough that cells move from exponential growth almost directly to a dying state.

In addition to that, a cell culture may be capable of metabolizing multiple kinds of nutrients with a hierarchy of preferences for them. For example, if our medium is abundant in two different sources of carbon, organisms may prefer to utilize one of them until depletion before switching to the other. This leads to another lag phase of adaptation, followed by another exponential phase, driven by the new limiting factor, a pattern described as "diauxic growth". Applying perturbations to a running experiment, like changing temperature, community composition, or modifying the medium, might also cause a non-canonical pattern of growth.

## Factors Affecting Growth

Microbial growth is only possible when all essential nutrients are provided and chemical and environmental conditions are met. Yet, there is a range of conditions that a species can live in. Therefore, their growth will be influenced by these factors. For instance, the temperature, pH, and oxygen level are some of the environmental factors that will affect their growth. On the other hand, the presence and availability of certain nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, will also influence their growth, as well as the competition for nutrients with other microorganisms if present.

### Temperature

As in a chemical reaction, microorganisms have a minimum, optimal, and maximum temperature when growing. As expected, growth will be maximal at an optimal temperature, and on the contrary growth will stop beyond the minimal and maximal temperatures. These values vary depending on the microbial species. In the specific case of bacteria, they can be classified into three groups: mesophiles, for bacteria able to grow at medium temperatures (usually between 25°C and 40°C), psychrophiles, for bacteria able to grow at low temperatures (usually between 0°C and 20°C), and thermophiles, for bacteria able to grow at high temperatures (usually between 50°C and 60°C).

### pH

pH affects the synthesis and structure of fundamental macromolecules for growth like DNA, proteins, and lipids. Thus, the acidity or basicity of the environment described by the pH also affects microbial growth. There are three main classifications in the case of bacteria according to their pH preferences: neutrophiles (grow at neutral pH), acidophiles (grow at very acidic pH: < 5.5), and alkaliphiles (growth at very alkaline pH: > 8.5).

### Oxygen Level

Aerobic species will only grow in the presence of oxygen; they obtain energy through aerobic respiration and use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. On the other hand, obligate anaerobic species will only grow when oxygen is not present; they obtain energy through fermentation and use organic or inorganic compounds as a terminal electron acceptor. Moreover, facultative anaerobic species will grow with or without oxygen.

### Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur and Phosphorus Sources

For microorganisms to be able to duplicate, they have to synthesize new cell components and macromolecules. Carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus sources are fundamental, they provide the chemical elements that are necessary for building cellular structures and support metabolic pathways. How microbes obtain these nutrients varies between species. For example, in the case of bacteria, they can obtain carbon from organic sources (chemoheterotrophs) or carbon dioxide (chemoautotrophs and photoautotrophs), nitrogen can be obtained from proteins or the atmosphere (nitrogen-fixing bacteria), sulfur can be obtained from proteins, sulfates, and hydrogen sulfide and phosphorus can be obtained from inorganic phosphate salts or buffers.

All of the environmental factors explained above will be important when setting up the right laboratory conditions that allow microbial growth under in vitro conditions.

## Methods of Culture

The methods of culture and experimental set-ups differ depending on the objective of the specific experiment. In general, growing microorganisms in the laboratory requires providing nutrients and environmental conditions needed to grow. There are mainly three techniques widely used to grow microbial populations in liquid culture: batch, fed-batch, and continuous growth.

### Batch Culture

A batch culture is a closed system, which means that it contains a fixed volume of nutrients or substrates in the medium. After the microbial cells are inoculated into the culture medium, they will grow until all the nutrients are depleted. At the same time that nutrients are consumed, metabolic byproducts and waste materials will accumulate in the culture flask. As mentioned before, some microbial organisms like bacteria cultivated in a batch reactor usually follow the four phases of growth described above: lag, exponential, stationary, and decline phase.

### Fed-batch Culture

A fed-batch culture is considered a modification from the common batch culture. Initially, the fed-batch culture operates in the same way as the batch culture until it reaches the end of the exponential phase. To extend the exponential phase, the reactor will be supplemented with a controlled feeding of nutrients, this feeding will extend the log phase resulting in an increased growth. As in the batch case, byproducts will accumulate.

### Continuous Culture

A continuous culture is characterized by the constant addition of new nutrients to the system while at the same time, the old culture broth is removed. The vessel used to grow a continuous culture is called a chemostat. In a chemostat, nutrients are continuously refreshed, while medium waste products and cells are continuously removed at the same time, resulting in wash-out if species do not divide fast enough. Because the influx and outflow rates are constant, the volume in a continuous culture is constant as well. The maximum working volume of the vessel will not limit the influx of new medium entering as in the case of the fed-batch culture. The influx of substrates and flow rate in a chemostat can be used to control the growth rate and the number of cells as well as expanding the exponential phase. Given that in a chemostat there is a constant influx and outflow of medium, a steady state (no increase or decrease in the number of cells) will be achieved when the growth rate is equal to the flow rate.
