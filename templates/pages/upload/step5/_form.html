      Your study will be publishable in <strong>24 hours</strong>. At that
      time, the button below will be enabled and will allow you to make your
      data visible to other people. You can find the study on the following
      page, which for the moment is visible only to you:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="{{ url_for('study_show_page', studyId=submission_form.study_id) }}">
        [{{ submission_form.study_id }}] {{ submission.studyDesign['study']['name'] }}
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to explore the data and validate that it matches your
      expectations. If you see any issues, you can update the study using this
      form.
