  Click the button to download the study template Excel file. The file contains
  four sheets:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>README</strong>: Read first before complete the other sheet. This
    provides detailed instruction for each of the columns in every of the
    following sheets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>STUDY</strong>: In this sheet you will have to complete the basic
    information of the Study you are about to upload.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EXPERIMENTS</strong>:In this sheet you will complete all the
    details of each of the experiments in your study. Each row represent an
    <strong>Experiment</strong> and each column specific information about it.
    Fill as many rows as many different experiments you have in your study.
    <strong>ORANGE COLUMNS</strong> are present in other sheets and should be
    completed with the same values.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>COMPARTMENTS</strong>: Details of the different compartments used
    for the experiments. If identical conditions across different experiments
    occur, these should be considered as a single compartment as long as they
    used the same microbial community. So complete as many rows as different
    conditions setups you have among the experiments in your study
    (<strong>EXPERIMENTS</strong> rows).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>COMMUNITY_MEMBERS</strong>: Information with respect to the various
    strains used in this study. This tab will be dynamically generated. Please
    used the same Member_IDs in the <strong>COMMUNITIES</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>COMMUNITIES</strong>: Define all the different communities used in
    your study by using the Member_IDs given in the
    <strong>COMMUNITY_MEMBERS</strong> sheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PERTURBATIONS</strong>: In this sheet you will fill all the
    information related to the different perturbations made to an experiment
    (<strong>Experiment_ID</strong>). There are two types of perturbations
    possible: when altering compartment conditions such as: pH, temperature
    etc. or when adding new microbial <strong>COMMUNITIES</strong> like:
    environmental samples or new microbial strains.
    <br>
    Complete each section carefully according to the instructions.
    <strong>DO NOT</strong> modify the file by adding or deleting columns.
