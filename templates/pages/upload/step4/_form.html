      Describe the physical containers of microbial communities as
      "compartments". For each different combination of environmental conditions,
      assign them a name and you'll associate these compartments to experiments
      in the next step.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might have a single compartment per vessel, but it's also possible to
      define e.g. broth and mucin beads floating inside as separate
      "compartments" that you measure separately as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Define all communities included in your experiments based on the strains
      you entered in step 2. If you've missed a strain you use, you can go back
      to that step and add it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each experiment will be defined with a single community. If your
      experiment involves changing the species composition (e.g. adding a new
      strain) during the experiment, you will be able to describe that by
      adding a perturbation from one defined community to another.
