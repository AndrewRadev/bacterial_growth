# Some ideas for the TechnicalReplicates:
- replicate date
- sampling time ==> one replicate do not have one specific ampling time. In one replicate we measure the abundance and the metabolites in several sampling points, which is what is written down in the files we will store.
- dilution
- serial dilutions??
